# Ergo-RPG
Originally planned to be a math game, Ergo RPG is mean to be my first attempt at an open world RPG with various factions.
The plan was to make it semi-historically accurate but still bring in some familiar RPG elements like the Dragons, loot, combat, character creations process, and a leveling system.

Right now it's just a python script that tests your skills with the times tables by making you fight people.
